- Write a function (guessing_game) that takes no arguments.
- When run, the function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
- Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.
- Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of the following:
    - Too high
    - Too low
    - Just right
- If the user guesses correctly, the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.
- The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.
